Index of folder retro-220/software/BALGOL:
Source, object, and assembly listings for the Burroughs Algebraic
Compiler, an implementation of Algol-58 for the Burroughs 220, as
prepared for the retro-220 emulator.

Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows text
format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.


BAC-220-Compiler.tape
    Loadable BALGOL compiler tape produced by the Generator.

BAC-220-Compiler-Callout.card
    Bootstrap card deck to load the compiler from its tape and initiate
    compilation. Source cards should follow this deck.

BAC-220-Generator-tape.
    Loadable generator tape.

BAC-220-Generator-Bootstrap.card
    Bootstrap card deck and configuration statements to generate an
    initial compiler tape and standard library. See BALGOL-Build-Notes
    for how this is used.

BAC-220-Generator-Callout.card
    Bootstrap card deck and typical configuration statements for
    generating a standard compiler tape from BAC-220-Generator.tape.

BALGOL-Build-Notes.txt
    Notes for bootstrapping the BALGOL Generator and Compiler programs
    from source code and generating loadable tapes for each one.

BALGOL-Generator.bacg
    Assembly listing of the BALGOL compiler-generator program,
    transcribed by Paul Kimpel from:
    http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/
    PDF_index/k-1-pdf/k-1-u2196-balgol220compiler.pdf.
    This program is written using a different assembly language than the
    other BALGOL components below.

BALGOL-Generator.card
    Card-image input deck of BALGOL-Generator.bacg prepared for input to
    the tools/GEN-Assembler script.

BALGOL-Generator-List.lst
    Assembly listing of BALGOL-Generator.card produced by the
    tools/GEN-Assembler.

BALGOL-Generator-Object.tape
    Object code tape image for the Generator produced by GEN-Assembler
    from BALGOL-Generator.card. See BALGOL-Build-Notes.txt for how this
    is used.

BALGOL-Generator-PoolSet.js
    JSON text file containing literal-pool pre-load values for use by
    the GEN-Assembler script in assembling the BALGOL-Generator utility.
    Pre-loading the literal pool assures that the same addresses will
    be assigned to literal values and strings in the pool as were
    originally assigned in the transcribed BALGOL-Generator.bacg
    listing.

BALGOL-Main.baca
    Assembly listing of the BALGOL compiler main-line module,
    transcribed by Paul Kimpel from:
    http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/
    PDF_index/k-1-pdf/k-1-u2196-balgol220compiler.pdf.
    This transcription reflects the corrections hand-coded on the
    listing.

BALGOL-Main.card
    Card-image input deck of BALGOL-Main.baca prepared for input to the
    tools/BAC-Assembler script.

BALGOL-Main-List.lst
    Assembly listing of BALGOL-Main.card produced by the
    tools/BAC-Assembler.

BALGOL-Main-Object.card
    Object code deck in BALGOL Machine Language format produced by BAC-
    Assembler from BALGOL-Main.card. See BALGOL-Build-Notes.txt for how
    this is used.

BALGOL-Main-PoolSet.js
    JSON text file containing literal-pool pre-load values for use by
    the BAC-Assembler script in assembling the BALGOL-Main.baca program.

BALGOL-Overlay.baca
    Assembly listing of the BALGOL compiler overlay module, transcribed
    by Paul Kimpel from:
    http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/
    PDF_index/k-1-pdf/k-1-u2196-balgol220compiler.pdf.
    This transcription reflects the corrections hand-coded on the
    listing.

BALGOL-Overlay.card
    Card-image input deck of BALGOL-Overlay.baca prepared for input to
    the tools/BAC-Assembler script.

BALGOL-Main-Overlay.lst
    Assembly listing of BALGOL-Overlay.card produced by the
    tools/BAC-Assembler.

BALGOL-Overlay-Object.card
    Object code deck in BALGOL Machine Language format produced by BAC-
    Assembler from BALGOL-Object.card. See BALGOL-Build-Notes.txt for
    how this is used.

BALGOL-Overlay-PoolSet.js
    JSON text file containing literal-pool pre-load values for use by
    the BAC-Assembler script in assembling the BALGOL-Overlay.baca
    program.

BALGOL-Library/
    Source files and object decks for the BALGOL standard function
    library, transcribed by Paul Kimpel from:
    http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/
    PDF_index/k-1-pdf/k-1-u2196-balgol220compiler.pdf.
    These transcriptions reflect some notations and corrections hand-
    coded on the listings.

    Files for each library routine XXXXX are named as follows:

        XXXXX.baca -- transcribed assembly listing.
        XXXXX.card -- card image deck extracted from the .baca file.
        XXXXX-List.lst -- listing generated by BAC-Assembler.
        XXXXX-Object.card -- object deck generated by BAC-Assembler.

    This folder also contains PUNCH-LIBRARY.card, the complete set of
    object decks for the compiler's standard library routines as
    produced by the Generator program PUNCH LIBRARY... statement.

BALGOL-Examples/
    Source code and listings for sample BALGOL programs.

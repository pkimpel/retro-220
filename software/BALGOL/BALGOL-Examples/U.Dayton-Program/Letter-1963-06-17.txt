Dear Warren:

     We have experienced some difficulty with procedures using the same
identifier both as an input and an output parameter.  Our research into
the problem has shed some light on the matter, however we have not complete-
ly solved the riddle.

     I am enclosing two ALGOL programs recently compiled by one of our
students.  In the one program the identifier DCM was used and ECM was
used in the other one.  This is the only difference in the two programs.
Our research has yielded the following:

             DCM = 444354 = 42 (mod 99)
             ECM = 454354 /=42 (mod 99)
             A = 41( & 1 for procedure) = 42

     If location 42 in the stack is occupied, then A must be stored else-
where and the procedure works, but if location 42 is open and A is stored
there, then the program does not work.

     We would appreciate someone looking into the matter.

     Thank you.

                                                Sincerely,



                                                Ronald L. McAdams

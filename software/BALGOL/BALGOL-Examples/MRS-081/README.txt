Source, object, and compilation listings for a BALGOL program from
Burroughs Technical Bulletin 156, 8 June 1961, Mathematical Report
Series MRS-081, "Diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease from Clinical
Data Using the Burroughs 220 Computer". The program listing is included
in the report and is noted as having been written by Fred B. Fielding of
the Burroughs San Francisco District office in May 1961.

This report was discovered during October 2019 in the Burroughs
Corporation Records, Product Literature (CBI 90), Charles Babbage
Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Series 74, Box 43,
Folder 8.

The program and report are based on a paper, "A Mathematical Approach to
Medical Diagnosis Applied to Congenital Heart Disease" by H. R. Warner,
A. F. Toronto, L.G. Veasy, and R. Stevenson. Journal of the American
Medical Association, 22 July 1961: 177(3), pp. 171-183,
doi:10.1001/jama.1961.03040290005002.

The report describes a program for computing the probability of a set of
congenital heart diseases occurring in a patient given the presence of a
set of symptoms observed in the patient. It includes sample data and an
example of using a machine-language subroutine with a BALGOL program.

To run the program, load the following decks into the Cardatron card
reader in the order indicated and compile with the BALGOL compiler:

    1.  BALGOL compiler call-out card.
    2.  MRS-081.card deck -- BALGOL source and machine-language cards.
    3.  SYMPTOM-DATA.card deck.
    4.  Case-data card deck, e.g., CASE-DATA.card.


MRS-081.card
    The BALGOL source deck, including the object deck for the machine-
    language subprogram. This is the original version of the BALGOL
    program, as transcribed from the report, but with a corrected
    version of the machine-language code for the UNPACK subroutine as
    discussed below.

MRS-081.lst
    Compilation and run listing generated from MRS-081.card with the
    SYMPTOM-DATA.card and CASE-DATA.card decks appended.

MRS-081-Code.lst
    Compilation and run listing generated from MRS-081.card as above,
    but including the object code generated by the compiler.

CASE-DATA.card
    Sample case-data card deck for input to the program, derived from
    sample run data in the report. This data must be inserted at the end
    of MRS-081.card deck when the program is run.

SYMPTOM-DATA.card
    Card deck for the symptom-disease probability matrix used by the
    program. This must be inserted after the cards in the MRS-081.card
    deck and before any case-data cards.

UNPACK.card
    Source deck for the machine-language UNPACK subprogram used by the
    BALGOL program to unpack rows from the symptom-disease probability
    matrix during execution. This deck was reverse-engineered from the
    numeric object code in the MRS-081.card deck and then modified to
    support the available compiler's parameter-passing scheme. Assemble
    with the BAC-Assembler.

    As published, the machine-language routine was written for the
    BALGOL parameter-passing sequence used in the compiler dated
    1961-02-20 -- the one used in the report. The compiler available to
    and recovered as part of the retro-220 project (dated 1962-02-01)
    passes parameters in the reverse order. Thus, this version of the
    subprogram was modified to use the recovered compiler's scheme. See
    Appendix F, "Construction of Machine Language Programs" in the March
    1963 Revised Edition of the BAC-220 Burroughs Algebraic Compiler
    manual (220-21017).

    The transcribed object code may never have had an assembler source
    and was likely programmed directly in numeric machine language.

UNPACK.lst
    Assembly listing generated from UNPACK.card.

UNPACK-ML.card
    Object machine-language card deck generated by assembling
    UNPACK.card. The BAC-Assembler produces a machine-language deck with
    six words per card. That output has been manually reformatted to
    match the (mostly) five word-per-card layout shown in the report.
    This reformatting was done to match the machine-language deck as
    presented in the report.

ORIGINAL-1961/
    Directory containing the original version of the UNPACK subroutine.
    See the included README file for details.

B5500/
    The BALGOL source, UNPACK subroutine, and data converted to
    Burroughs B5500 Extended Algol, as supported by the retro-b5500
    emulator.

E-MODE/
    The BALGOL source, UNPACK subroutine, and data converted to modern
    Unisys ClearPath MCP Extended Algol.

Note that the results from the BALGOL program differ somewhat from those
published in the report. The results from the B5500/ and E-MODE/
versions of the program agree with each other and much more closely with
those in the report. Some variance between the 220 results and those for
the B5500 and modern E-Mode systems is to be expected, as the 220
carries only eight decimal digits of floating-point precision and does
not round floating-point add/subtract, while the latter two systems
carry 11.5 digits (39 bits) and round.

The more significant variance between the BALGOL results and the report
is probably due to the way the arithmetic operators are presently
implemented in the retro-220 emulator, as we do not have complete
information on the way those operators were actually mechanized in a
real 220. These variances remain under investigation.

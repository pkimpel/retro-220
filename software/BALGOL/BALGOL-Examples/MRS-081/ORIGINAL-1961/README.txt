ORIGINAL-1961:


UNPACK.card
    Source deck for the machine-language UNPACK subprogram used by the
    BALGOL program to unpack rows from the symptom-disease probability
    matrix during execution. This deck was reverse-engineered from the
    numeric object code in the MRS-081 report. Assemble with the
    BAC-Assembler.

    As published, the machine-language routine was written for the
    BALGOL parameter-passing sequence used in the compiler dated
    1961-02-20 -- the one used in the report. The compiler available to
    and recovered as part of the retro-220 project (dated 1962-02-01)
    passes parameters in the reverse order.

    Thus, this version of the subprogram cannot be used with the
    available compiler. See Appendix F, "Construction of Machine
    Language Programs" in the March 1963 Revised Edition of the BAC-220
    Burroughs Algebraic Compiler manual (220-21017).

UNPACK.lst
    Assembly listing generated from UNPACK.card.

UNPACK-ML.card
    Object machine-language card deck generated by assembling
    UNPACK.card. The BAC-Assembler produces a machine-language deck with
    six words per card. That output has been manually reformatted to
    match the (mostly) five word-per-card layout shown in the report.
    This reformatting was done to match the machine-language deck as
    presented in the report and to allow direct verification of the
    assembled object code with the transcribed object code. The
    transcribed object code may never have had an assembler source and
    was likely programmed directly in numeric machine language.
